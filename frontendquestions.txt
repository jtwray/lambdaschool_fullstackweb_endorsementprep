Frontend Questions

  A company needs you to make their website more accessble. What are some of the first things you consider?
    - Checking for appropriate alt tags on images. These should be present and include a decription of the image.
    - CHecking for and adding labels on all form inputs.
    - Using LIghthouse or simliar api to check for color contrast on fonts and background images to ensure theere is a high enough contrast to account for colorblindness.
    - Incorporate use of sematic html tags to assist screen readers.

  What are callbakcs and higher order functions?
    - Higher order functions are reuasble sets of instructions in a scripting language assigned to a point in memory with a variable. aka a function. The difference between them and a regular function is that the Higher-Order-Funciton accepts another function as one or more of its arguments.
    you pass in a second function as the parameter to a higherorder function.  
    - A callback is the function passed into a H.o.f. as an argument.

  When are asynchronous methods useful Why are Async/Await, Callbacks, and Promises useful?
    - Asynchronous methods are handy when you need to write nonblocking code. In other words wehn you have a piece of logic that needs to run independently fromt he main stream of the program.
    Examples in web development would be for api calls to retreive a dataset or other user input that rely on some type of user triggered event.
    When you have more than one thing that needs to happen and one of them takes an undefined amount of time.
   
    - Async/Await has improvements mad eto the logic and statemachine under the hood to runn faster than promises. Async/Await can be used to write code that reads in a more synchorous fashion.
    - Callbacks are used typically when you are constructing a piece of logic to be triggered by a particular event or state.  Callbacks are also used while looping through datasets.
    - Promises can be used to create error boundaries. You can set them up to allow for different instances of an API response in a form of state machine.
    If successful response do this to the dataset we received
    if you catch this error display it to the console or append it to the dom with this set of instructions
    if the response includes this logic follow this third set of logic.
    finally no matter which response type we received you should follow this logic as well.
